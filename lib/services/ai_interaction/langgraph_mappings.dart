/// Mapping between Langgraph and local data models
/// 
/// The ai_chat_service_provider class handles the mapping between the local data models and the langgraph data models.
/// 
/// Instead, This file should be used to define the mapping between the local data models and the langgraph data models.
/// 
/// And then used in ai_chat_service_provider class.
