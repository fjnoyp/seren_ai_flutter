1. For custom notification icons (recommended), you should add them as drawable resources in:
```android/app/src/main/res/drawable/```

> **XML vector drawables**
>
> Android's vector format
> Must be white and transparent
> Example filename: notification_icon.xml

2. If you plan to use custom notification sounds, add them as raw resources in:
```android/app/src/main/res/raw/```
