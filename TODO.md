# Mattheus Comments
- The AI voice feature creates tasks in the wrong project. Specify the project name for accurate task creation.
- Enable task creation directly on the Gantt chart.

Top priorities:
1. A main panel showing today's tasks and upcoming ones, accessible with a few clicks for efficient time management.
2. The homepage should list all tasks to complete, followed by projects. Clicking a project reveals all related tasks.
3. Display two interfaces on the same page: one for tasks to complete and another for project details.
