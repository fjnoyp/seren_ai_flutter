Auto-Generated End-of-Day Reports:
Receive a concise daily summary of your projectâ€™s progress, including completed tasks, delays, and pending tasks.

# Mattheus Comments
- The AI voice feature creates tasks in the wrong project. Specify the project name for accurate task creation.
- Enable task creation directly on the Gantt chart.

2. The homepage should list all tasks to complete, followed by projects. Clicking a project reveals all related tasks.
3. Display two interfaces on the same page: one for tasks to complete and another for project details.
